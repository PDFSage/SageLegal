_________________________________________)

         COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

Plaintiff, BO SHANG (“Plaintiff” or “Shang”), appearing pro se, alleges as follows:

I.   NATURE OF THE ACTION

1.   Plaintiff brings this action against Defendant ALPHABE INC (hereinafter “Defendant,”
     “Google,” or “Alphabet”) under various California consumer-protection and unfair-
     competition statutes, as well as common-law doctrines and other potential grounds.
     Plaintiff challenges Defendant’s Terms of Service (“TOS”) regarding generative artificial
     intelligence (“AI”) content.

2.   Specifically, Plaintiff alleges:
     - Defendant’s so-called AI-generated content is merely “branded math” resulting from
       mathematical transformations of data.
     - Defendant’s TOS purport to prohibit the public’s acquisition or use of this “math” in
       ways that infringe on fundamental principles of intellectual freedom and fair
       competition.
     - Defendant’s contradictory conduct (providing free trial credits, developer assistance,
       etc.) while threatening enforcement under these TOS has caused Plaintiff and the
       public to suffer confusion, wasted time, and potential liability concerns.

3.   Plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, damages, restitution, and other remedies
     under:
     - California’s Unfair Competition Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17200, et seq.);
     - California’s False Advertising Law (Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17500, et seq.);
     - California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (Cal. Civ. Code § 1750, et seq.);
     - Common-law contract theories (e.g., unconscionability, void for public policy);
     - Declaratory relief (Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1060);
     - and, as applicable, the Lanham Act, antitrust laws, or other doctrines.

4.   Plaintiff additionally seeks substantial monetary damages to compensate for injuries
     caused by Defendant’s purported attempt to monopolize or control access to “basic math
     knowledge,” interfering with scientific freedom and the public’s right to learn and
     innovate.

II.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5.   Jurisdiction in the Superior Court of California: This Court has subject-matter
     jurisdiction over the causes of action asserted under California law. To the extent
     Plaintiff asserts federal statutes (Lanham Act, Sherman Act, etc.), state courts have
     concurrent jurisdiction unless/until removed to federal court.

6.   Venue is proper in Santa Clara County because Defendant maintains its headquarters
     and principal place of business in Mountain View, California (which is located in Santa
     Clara County). A substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims
     occurred in this County.

III. THE PARTIES

7.   Plaintiff BO SHANG is a natural person acting pro se, residing in __________________,
     who researches and develops machine-learning technologies. Plaintiff has been subject
     to Defendant’s TOS that purport to prohibit usage of “AI-generated content” for ML
     purposes, thereby causing confusion, wasted time, and chilling effects on Plaintiff’s
     research.

8.   Defendant ALPHABE INC (intentionally missing one character) is a Delaware
     corporation headquartered in Mountain View, California. It is the parent company of
     Google and offers AI-powered products and services worldwide, including “Gemini,”
     “Bard,” and other generative models.

IV.  FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

     A. Defendant’s Generative AI as “Branded Math”

9.   Defendant operates generative AI models producing text, images, or other content based
     on user prompts. From a scientific standpoint, these models rely on linear algebra,
     probability distributions, and other fundamental mathematical processes to generate
     outputs. Plaintiff contends that labeling such output “proprietary” is akin to
     monopolizing “math transformations.”

10.  Plaintiff alleges that by branding these outputs as “Google AI content,” Defendant claims
     the right to impose broad licensing restrictions that effectively ban others from using
     or re-transforming that “math” for competing ML/AI projects.

     B. TOS Restricting Use of AI Outputs

11.  On or about __________, 202__, Defendant revised or introduced TOS stating: “You may
     not use AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or
     related AI technology.” Plaintiff asserts that these provisions are vague, overbroad,
     and/or unconscionable—conflicting with open research norms.

12.  Because no consistent method exists to label or watermark Google’s AI outputs, users
     risk inadvertently ingesting “AI content” into their own ML workflows, potentially
     violating the TOS and causing fear and uncertainty.

     C. Free Trials, Prompt Assistance, & Contradictory Conduct

13.  Defendant entices developers (including Plaintiff) with free credits (e.g., a $1,000 trial) to
     experiment with “Gemini” or “GenAI Builder.” These tools even guide users in writing
     prompts or scripts—yet at the same time, the TOS suggest that using such “output” in
     any derivative AI model might be disallowed.

14.  Plaintiff claims that the TOS’s sweeping prohibition is self-contradictory, leading to
     confusion, wasted resources, and potential liability for simply handling “branded math.”

     D. Harm to Plaintiff

15.  Plaintiff’s ML research was effectively chilled by fear of TOS violations. Plaintiff
     suffered direct damages in the form of lost time, potential cancellations of research
     projects, and an unwillingness to further experiment with Gemini or similar services.
     Plaintiff demands compensatory damages, as well as punitive or exemplary damages
     to deter future overreach by Defendant.

16.  Plaintiff contends that restricting the flow of “math knowledge” is harmful to the public,
     threatens open scientific inquiry, and violates fundamental societal norms in technology
     and free speech.

17.  Additionally, Plaintiff is subscribed to Gemini for Google Workspace as well as Colab
     Premium. Each communication that might contain or respond to AI-generated content
     potentially subjects Plaintiff or third parties (e.g., MIT) to future legal claims under
     Defendant’s TOS, further exacerbating confusion and a chilling effect.

18.  On or about __________, 202__, Plaintiff contacted Google One Support to complain
     about the allegedly “illegal” TOS and to seek clarification regarding whether Defendant
     genuinely intended to ban the public from using “mathematical transformations.” The
     support personnel did not provide clear guidance, reinforcing the confusion over the
     TOS’s broad reach.

19.  Plaintiff explicitly pointed out that Google’s search engine itself is fundamentally built
     on “basic math,” and that restricting the use of math would be both infeasible and
     contrary to open scientific inquiry. The support representative appeared unaware that
     math underpinned Google’s core offerings.

20.  Plaintiff believes that if Google’s legal department insists on barring third parties from
     using “basic math transformations,” then logically Google should also bar its own
     engineers from continuing to develop math-based technology—illustrating the TOS’s
     contradictory and unworkable nature.

V.   FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
     (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17200, et seq.)

21.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth
     herein.

22.  Statutory Basis: California’s Unfair Competition Law (“UCL”), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code
     § 17200, et seq., prohibits “unlawful, unfair or fraudulent” business practices.

23.  “Unfair” Prong:
     - Under Cel-Tech Commc’ns, Inc. v. Los Angeles Cellular Tel. Co., 20 Cal.4th 163 (1999),
       an act is “unfair” if it violates the policy or spirit of antitrust or other laws.
     - Defendant’s TOS that purportedly restrict fundamental math transformations for AI
       research violate public policy favoring open science and fair competition.

24.  “Unlawful” Prong:
     - Defendant’s TOS and conduct may also violate other laws (including antitrust or
       consumer protection laws) and thus be “unlawful” under the UCL.

25.  Relief Sought: Injunctive relief preventing enforcement of the TOS, restitution, and any
     other relief authorized under Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code § 17203.

VI.  SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
     (VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA BUSINESS & PROFESSIONS CODE § 17500, et seq.)

26.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth
     herein.

27.  Statutory Basis: California’s False Advertising Law (“FAL”), Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code
     § 17500, et seq., prohibits disseminating untrue or misleading statements in connection
     with the sale of goods or services.

28.  Defendant’s promotional materials and TOS disclaimers are misleading or contradictory
     because they simultaneously:
     - Encourage users to experiment with AI tools (e.g., “GenAI Builder”),
     - Yet purport to ban “using AI-generated content” for machine-learning models.

29.  Such contradictory statements likely mislead developers and the general public
     regarding the permissible scope of AI usage, in violation of the FAL.

30.  Relief Sought: Injunctive relief, restitution, and other appropriate remedies under Cal.
     Bus. & Prof. Code § 17535.

VII. THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
     (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT (“CLRA”),
      CAL. CIV. CODE § 1750, et seq.)

31.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth
     herein.

32.  Statutory Basis: The CLRA (Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1750–1784) bars deceptive practices
     in consumer transactions. Civil Code § 1770(a) enumerates unlawful acts such as
     misrepresenting the nature of goods or services or their usage limitations.

33.  Plaintiff qualifies as a “consumer” when using Google’s AI services for personal or
     research purposes. Defendant’s contradictory TOS and marketing materials allegedly
     misrepresent the permissible uses of its AI output.

34.  Relief Sought: Actual damages, injunctive relief, restitution, potential punitive
     damages, and attorneys’ fees (if awarded) under Cal. Civ. Code § 1780.

VIII. FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
      (COMMON-LAW CONTRACT THEORIES & UNCONSCIONABILITY)

35.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth
     herein.

36.  California contract law deems a contract (or TOS) void or unenforceable if it is
     unconscionable, ambiguous, or contrary to public policy. See Cal. Civ. Code §§ 1667,
     1670.5; Armendariz v. Found. Health Psychare Servs., Inc., 24 Cal.4th 83 (2000).

37.  Procedural Unconscionability: Defendant’s TOS is a non-negotiable “clickwrap” or
     “browsewrap,” leaving users no meaningful choice.

38.  Substantive Unconscionability: The TOS purports to ban an essential category of
     intellectual endeavor (“math transformations”)—offending public policy favoring
     scientific progress and open competition.

39.  Plaintiff therefore asserts that the TOS is unconscionable or otherwise void against
     public policy, and seeks a court declaration to that effect.

40.  Remedy: Plaintiff seeks declaratory relief finding the TOS void or unenforceable,
     plus compensatory and/or punitive damages for the harm caused by reliance on or
     confusion arising from these TOS.

IX.   FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
      (DECLARATORY RELIEF – CAL. CODE CIV. PROC. § 1060)

41.  Plaintiff incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth
     herein.

42.  An actual controversy exists as to whether Defendant’s TOS is lawful or enforceable
     insofar as it purports to bar others from using or acquiring “AI-generated content”
     (i.e., “branded math”).

43.  Under Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 1060, the Court may “make a binding declaration of
     [the parties’] rights or duties.”

44.  Plaintiff requests a judicial declaration that:
     - Defendant’s TOS is overbroad, unconscionable, and unenforceable;
     - Enforcement of these provisions violates California law; and
     - Users (including Plaintiff) have the lawful right to incorporate “AI outputs” for
       machine-learning or research purposes, consistent with open science.

45.  Such a declaration will resolve ongoing confusion and prevent further harm to Plaintiff
     and the public.

X.    OTHER POTENTIAL GROUNDS

46.  Lanham Act (15 U.S.C. § 1125(a)): If Defendant’s statements about controlling “branded
     math” or restricting the “nature, characteristics, or qualities” of AI content are false or
     misleading in commercial advertising, Plaintiff may have a claim under Section 43(a)
     of the Lanham Act. State courts have concurrent jurisdiction over Lanham Act claims.

47.  Sherman Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 1–2) & Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. §§ 12–27): If Defendant’s
     conduct effectively monopolizes or restrains the use of AI content for ML research,
     substantially lessening competition in the relevant market or tending to create a
     monopoly, antitrust liability could arise. Plaintiff reserves the right to pursue these
     claims or any related state antitrust provisions as discovery warrants.

48.  Plaintiff reserves the right to amend this Complaint to assert additional causes of action
     or theories of liability, including but not limited to any copyright-related issues, if
     warranted by further investigation.

XI.   PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully prays for judgment in Plaintiff’s favor and against
Defendant as follows:

1.    **Injunctive Relief**: Enjoining Defendant from enforcing the TOS to prohibit lawful ML
      research or usage of AI-generated content, or from misleading users about their rights
      to apply “branded math.”

2.    **Declaratory Relief**: Declaring that Defendant’s TOS provisions restricting the use of AI
      outputs are void and unenforceable under California law, as they are contrary to public
      policy and/or unconscionable.

3.    **Restitution and Damages**: Awarding restitution, compensatory damages, and
      consequential damages, including but not limited to:
      - The monetary value of wasted time, lost research opportunities, or resources expended
        in attempting to comply with ambiguous TOS.
      - Any fees or expenses incurred due to fear of litigation under these TOS.

4.    **Punitive/Exemplary Damages**: Imposing punitive damages in an amount sufficient to
      deter similar conduct by Defendant or others, in light of Defendant’s attempt to
      monopolize or restrict fundamental mathematical knowledge.

5.    **Attorneys’ Fees and Costs**: Awarding attorneys’ fees and costs (to the extent allowed
      for pro se litigants or upon subsequent retention of counsel) under applicable statutes,
      including but not limited to the CLRA (Cal. Civ. Code § 1780(e)), UCL, or private attorney
      general provisions.

6.    **Pre- and Post-Judgment Interest**: Awarding interest at the highest lawful rate on all
      sums awarded.

7.    **Other Relief**: Granting such other and further relief as this Court deems just, equitable,
      and proper.
