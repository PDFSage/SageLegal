WORK EXPERIENCE
PDFSage Inc. — Burlington, MA, USA
Full-Stack and Machine Learning Engineer (December 2024 – Present)
	•	With no prior PDF framework experience, developed a PDF annotation-flattening solution using PDFKit and SwiftUI—demonstrating adaptability and a steep learning trajectory.
HEAVILY EMPHASIZED: I cannot sell AIPoints or Premium because there’s no “functions” in between the client end and ghidra’s permission to write into userid Firestore
	•	Proactively deferred the launch of an incomplete subscription offering, prioritizing robust feature development and user satisfaction over rapid monetization.
	•	Established a C-Corporation in Delaware with 100% ownership; completed IRS share purchase in January 2025.
	•	Created an AI-driven PDF application featuring a job-controller for bulk, multi-threaded tasks, supporting both iOS and web platforms.
	•	Achieved rapid user adoption (hundreds of users in the first week of iOS release), monitored via Firebase Auth and AIPoints integration.
	•	Continuously enhancing PDFSage to surpass Adobe Acrobat Pro in both features and user experience.
	•	Released “PDFSage Device Tools” as a comprehensive iOS utility, with frequent updates to maintain its position as a go-to resource.
	•	Initiated proprietary machine learning models:
	•	ExploitGPT: A fully proprietary, from-scratch multi-layer Transformer model focused on vulnerability scanning and exploit generation.
	•	StupidityModel: A classification and generative ML framework designed for comedic or “naive” generation tasks.
	•	Expanded into game development, implementing a Connect 4 AI with minimax and alpha-beta pruning, and future plans for Alpha Zero integration. Supports cross-platform player-vs-player (web, iOS, Android).
	•	Developing a GenAI video tutorial platform (AWS IVS + YouTube) for live demos, interactive chats, and real-time Q&A.
	•	Prototyped AIPoints for potential premium AI features, maintaining a focus on robust, reliable functionality and shared Firebase Auth across all applications.
Various Startups — United States & China
Engineer and Business Developer (2017 – 2024)
	•	Contributed to multiple early-stage ventures, including a China-based nutrition supplement startup targeting diabetes prevention, an innovative dating platform, and various tech-oriented initiatives.
	•	Concurrently pursued graduate-level Computer Science courses, enhancing expertise in algorithms and software engineering.
ONE Consulting Inc. — Hong Kong, SAR
IT Consultant (2014 – 2015)
	•	Assisted in designing and maintaining IT infrastructure for a major Apple supplier with over USD $1B in annual revenue.
Kensho Technologies Inc. — Cambridge, MA, USA
Product Manager, Events Database (2013 – 2014)
	•	Led the Events Database project, converting unstructured data into structured insights using Python-based data extraction scripts.
	•	Provided business intelligence on how global events could impact capital markets; designed cost-effective, high-performance data-processing algorithms.
	•	As an early hire, contributed substantially to Kensho’s Series A and B fundraising rounds, culminating in a strategic partnership with S&P Global and a $550M acquisition in 2018.
EDUCATION

	•	Professional Certificate for Learning Python for Data Science (2023–2025)
Tufts University – School of Engineering — Medford, MA
	•	Bachelor of Science in Engineering Science, cum laude (2006 – 2010)
	•	GPA: 3.4/4.0 (Undergrad); 4.0/4.0 (Graduate courses); 3.9/4.0 in Computer Science
SKILLS & ACCOMPLISHMENTS
	•	Programming & Tools: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, Swift, Kotlin, Go (some), Rust (some), TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, MAUI .NET (Visual Studio IDE), Xcode, Android Studio
	•	Frameworks & Platforms: Next.js, Angular (CLI), React, Firebase, Azure, AWS (various services including advanced ML pipelines)
	•	Machine Learning & AI: Transformer-based models, classification/generative tasks, multi-layer neural networks, advanced ML frameworks (including ExploitGPT)
	•	Security Engineering: Developed scanners and exploit models referencing CVEs/exploit databases; integrated advanced scanning workflows into ExploitGPT
	•	Game Development: Created cross-platform Connect 4 AI with alpha-beta pruning (planned Alpha Zero integration); integrated multiplayer and leaderboards
	•	Mobile & Web Apps: Experience with multiple iOS apps in Swift (including GameCenter integration), Android apps, cross-platform/cloud backends with Firebase Auth
	•	Cloud Infrastructure: Extensive work with Google Cloud and AWS (compute, ML, analytics); previously supported an NBA player recommendation system using ML at a Google event
	•	Payment & Monetization: Implemented Stripe APIs on iOS; exploring “AIPoints” for usage-based monetization and premium feature sets
NOTABLE PROJECTS
	•	PDFSage: AI-driven PDF tool enabling text reflow, scanning, advanced editing, multi-media integration, and cross-platform functionality
	•	ExploitGPT: Proprietary vulnerability scanner and exploit generator powered by custom Transformer models, trained on CVE and exploitdb data
