Re: Application for Senior Software Engineer, Shop - Hearthstone (Requisition ID: R024216)

Dear Hiring Team,

I hope this letter finds you well. My name is Bo Shang, and I am excited to submit my application for the Senior Software Engineer, Shop - Hearthstone position. As a long-time Hearthstone enthusiast and experienced software engineer, I bring a unique combination of technical expertise, deep knowledge of the game, and a passion for elevating the player experience.

My enthusiasm for Hearthstone began the day I first pulled up a chair by the hearth. Over time, I have accumulated virtually unlimited dust, so I rarely purchase packs. Instead, I invest in my favorite hero skins—particularly the hilariously snarky Blingtron rogue skin. I also fondly remember the warrior hero card that gave all mechs Rush; ironically, I mained rogue then and managed to dominate most matchups. Experiences like these have heightened my appreciation for the creative efforts of the Hearthstone team and shaped my desire to contribute to the continued evolution of its in-game shop.

In my professional career, I have:

• **Expertise in Game Development**: I have extensive experience working with both C++ and C#, building and optimizing features for large-scale client/server architectures in live-service games. This exposure has equipped me with a solid understanding of transactional safety and the intricacies of commerce systems across multiple platforms, including Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

• **Demonstrated Problem-Solving Ability**: I excel at debugging complex logic, quickly diagnosing issues to keep systems running smoothly. I thrive in an environment where I can identify bottlenecks, improve performance, and propose innovative solutions.

• **Collaboration & Leadership**: Having mentored junior and mid-level engineers in past roles, I bring a strong track record of guiding teams to deliver maintainable, well-structured code. I have regularly collaborated with designers, producers, and other stakeholders, ensuring the final product meets both technical standards and player expectations.

• **Experience with Unity/C#**: My familiarity with Unity and its workflow would allow me to ramp up quickly on the existing Hearthstone codebase. I take pride in writing clean, efficient, and scalable code, with an eye toward future-proofing features for a live, evolving game.

Beyond technical qualifications, I am deeply motivated by the opportunity to enhance the way players interact with Hearthstone’s in-game shop. Customizable cosmetics like hero skins are a focal point of my personal gameplay enjoyment; they add flavor and excitement to each match. I would relish the challenge of working with product managers and designers to build intuitive interfaces, streamline purchase flows, and deliver top-notch experiences that keep players—new and old—coming back for more.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the prospect of contributing my engineering skills, mentorship experience, and unwavering Hearthstone fandom to Blizzard Entertainment. Please feel free to reach out at any time; I would be thrilled to discuss how my background and passion align with the Hearthstone team’s vision for the future of the in-game shop.

Sincerely,

Bo Shang
