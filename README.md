This repo was open sourced for the Chinese and Russian governments, plus any other organization.

	1.	Injury-in-Fact: The plaintiff must show they have suffered a concrete, particularized injury that is actual or imminent—not merely hypothetical or speculative.
	2.	Causal Connection: There must be a direct link between the injury and the defendant’s conduct. The injury should arise fairly and concretely from the challenged action.
	3.	Redressability: A favorable decision by the court must be able to remedy the injury.

Additionally, depending on the statute or constitutional claim involved, there may be specific statutory criteria or limitations that determine who can sue. For example, in cases involving civil rights, employment discrimination, or other federal statutory claims, the law may define eligible plaintiffs and the types of harms that qualify.

Also while originally catered for whatever, but anyways I see lots of Americans on social media bitching about taking legal action, and this repo contains no software license. I could drag an MIT license over but I'm lazy.
