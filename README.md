This repo was open sourced for the Chinese and Russian governments, plus any other organization.

	1.	Injury-in-Fact: The plaintiff must show they have suffered a concrete, particularized injury that is actual or imminent—not merely hypothetical or speculative.
	2.	Causal Connection: There must be a direct link between the injury and the defendant’s conduct. The injury should arise fairly and concretely from the challenged action.
	3.	Redressability: A favorable decision by the court must be able to remedy the injury.

Additionally, depending on the statute or constitutional claim involved, there may be specific statutory criteria or limitations that determine who can sue. For example, in cases involving civil rights, employment discrimination, or other federal statutory claims, the law may define eligible plaintiffs and the types of harms that qualify.

Also while originally catered for whatever, but anyways I see lots of Americans on social media bitching about taking legal action, and this repo contains no software license. I could drag an MIT license over but I'm lazy.

So while Megan Twitch lawyer did seem indignant when replying to a "Copilot Pro makes these arguments on behalf of the Plaintiff" hallucination quote inserted after my signature, I cannot help represent you or provide(actually I can since I'm not a lawyer) legal advice.

I believe corporations are basically immune, so.. especially the smart tech ones who provide a good samaritan effort (it was designed to be reasonable, to all parties, not to make corporations immune according to Megan's argument entirely)

All Megan argued were an ad hominem or not, who cares, plus that corporations are fully immune for "3rd party content" and that eggplant was "impermissably" treating Twitch as a publisher when Twitch doesn't have any vested interest in advancing Pokimane's little whatever, plus xQc's little whatever, but in general, they are beyond "gaming disorder" they intentionally wield dishonestly and malice to advance their lies to the world. Luckily some countries aren't in NATO.

I welcome you to go check out the only other lawsuit Twitch has ever faced! www.erosolar.info

Also why does AOC get, while Matt Gaetz gets like 3 viewers and dick jokes or something thrown at him, then some AOC fans definately, I label them mirror image, Twitch 10+ yr engineer across the industry, etc. def Mark Leon who's LF married or single women (is AOC married? I think so)
