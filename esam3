EXHIBIT 3: Linkedin comments and likes are entirely from blondes, who didn't even catch the first thing anyone ever learns in cryptography. While the Plaintiff knew about asymettric vs symettric encryption before enrolling in Discrete Mathematics at Tufts, one assignment was to fully explain and code the real RSA protocol, which is the only fundamental asymmetric encryption foundational piece that exist today. While more complex systems such as PGP encryption, as this court may be well aware of when browsing servers hosted via the onion protocol, PGP could not work without using RSA. PGP private and public keys are in fact RSA based, and PGP simply makes the system more user friendly for humans.
